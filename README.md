# ClothingStore
Using object oriented principles, I created a clothing store. 
I made separate files for the clothing items and included several choices for each item such as size and type. After finding the right item, it overrides the base member and base methods to display the cart and total. The shopper's items will be stored into the array and can be shown by choosing the display cart items option. Display cart total is also an option once shopping is complete.
