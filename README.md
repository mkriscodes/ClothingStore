# ClothingStore
Using object oriented principles, I created a clothing store that allows items to be added to the cart by using an array to store them.
I made separate files for the clothing items. I also gave a couple of choices for each item. The choices such as (size, type of hat, etc) will be stored into the array and can be shown by choosing the display cart items option. Display cart total is also a choice once shopping is complete.
