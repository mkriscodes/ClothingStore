# ClothingStore
Using the Java programming language I created a clothing store using concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance to create base and derived classes. Polymorphism helped me with overriding base members and methods to provide different implementations for each clothing item. I then used instances of those objects to update the userâ€™s options in my Main.cpp file to display their chosen items and total once they are done shopping.
